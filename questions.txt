helpful: to see roberts court 
# citations per case
amicus briefs
length of decision --> short majority == long dissent
# pluralities vs majorities under which court!!!!! what does that mean?
pref/ideo voting --> 5-4 ==> dissent
per curiam

3/26 notes EXP-074-F

"believe the children"

CII: people didn't know what they were doing; no research on child victim witnesses. kee macfarlane -- pioneers idea of the anatomically correct doll

put pressure on kids to get the right answer. "we already have the answer, don't you want to help?" --> indirectly pressuring
"play out" what happened instead of explicitly explaining.
puppet == authority figure ==> problem
berated them until they got the "right" answer
adult-driven
follow scripts: bad ==> why haven't you told us about this?
defense received tapes that had been erased ==> horribly unfair
